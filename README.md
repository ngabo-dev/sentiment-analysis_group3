## Project Overview
This project examines and compares the performance of various machine learning models for sentiment analysis on publicly available text datasets, such as the IMDb movie reviews dataset. The objective is to evaluate one traditional machine learning approach (SVM or Logistic Regression) against two deep learning architectures (RNN or LSTM), highlighting their respective strengths and weaknesses.


**Key Findings:**
* The comparison between deep learning and traditional models provides insights into the trade-offs between computational cost, architectural complexity, and predictive performance.
